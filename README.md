## Simple wave portal built by Divine Edeh
### Features
- It allows you to connect your wallet
- You can type in a message for me
- You can verify the message on your metamask wallet. (Rinkeby testnet network :))
- A random waver is chosen and awarded 0.001 ether
- The waver is printed in a table with the time, wallet address and message.

### Note:
- Before you can send me a wave, you must have some fake eth in your rinkeby metamask wallet
- Your wallet must be rinkeby test network</p>
- Get some fake eth "https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby"
- Now you can send me a wave! Oh, and your wallet address will be printed below :)
- You'll get a little prize if you wave at me :) But you can't wave more than once! After each wave, wait 30 seconds before you can wave again else, it won't work! :)

Thank you! ðŸ˜Š
